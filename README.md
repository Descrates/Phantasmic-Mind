# Putting Works into Proper Folders
To put code into folders edit the directory of the file, make sure to type it like so:  Phantasmic-Mind/Code/... 
What ever it may be
With art it's a tad more tricky just tell us when you add it too the git then we will upload to the folder

# Pull Requests

This is how we will resolve the issues that would come up along the game's processes
The pull request will be done via the creation of a new file that will reference the original issue
This is done in the code page by creating a new code/file, going to the end of the page to find the selection that offers it to make a separate branch+a pull request
Select this to create a pull request and add a comment on the new branch to indicate that the pull request is to resolve an issue
Then when this is done, go to the comment section and there would be a selection to reference an issue; find the appropriate issue and select it and there, the pull request has been created

# Making Branches 
Create a new file and when you're scrolling down to commit it hit the check mark box for a new branch.
