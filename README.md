## What to do when you are finished with an issue
1. Make sure to tell whomever assigned it to you (ie your lead) that it is done
2. Give them the file or what ever you worked on
3. Make sure that they know that this happened and it wasnt a side conversation
4. Once the file is then uploaded to the main one we will close the issue
5. Move on to another issue that is assigned to you or ask for one from your lead
            (That means not the President or Vice President unless that is your lead)
